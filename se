1.	Clone the shared repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
2.	Navigate to the repository directory:
bash
Copy code

o	Review your changes, provide a title for the PR (e.g., "Add feature XYZ"), and describe what changes you have made.
o	Click "Create pull request" to submit your changes for review.
________________________________________
Result
1.	Forked Repository Created:
o	A fork of the original repository was successfully created in your GitHub account.
2.	Cloned the Forked Repository:
o	The repository was cloned to your local machine, allowing you to work on it.
3.	Created a Feature Branch:
o	A new branch was created to isolate your changes from the main branch, ensuring that your work does not affect the existing code.
4.	Changes Implemented and Committed:
o	Your feature or changes were successfully implemented, staged, and committed.
5.	Changes Pushed to Forked Repository:
o	The changes were pushed to your forked repository on GitHub.
